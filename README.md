== DESCRIPTION ==
=================

Simulation of long chain network formation through spike time dependent plasticity and heterosynaptic long term depression. This simulation aligns with Figure 2 in the associated paper, imposing binary neuron network dynamics and a summed weight limit.  After weights are learned random, bursts are provided to initiate activity and playback is plotted.
